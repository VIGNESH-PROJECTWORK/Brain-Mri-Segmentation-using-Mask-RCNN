Overview
This project focuses on brain segmentation using the Mask R-CNN model implemented with Detectron2. The goal is to accurately detect and segment various regions of the brain from medical images, helping in the analysis of brain structures, diseases, and abnormalities. This segmentation model is ideal for medical professionals and researchers to streamline their workflows in brain analysis tasks.

Dataset
The dataset consists of medical images of the brain, with annotations marking different regions for segmentation. The dataset is preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets, allowing for efficient model training and performance evaluation.

Algorithms Used
Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation
Detectron2 framework for efficient object detection and segmentation
Usage
To use the Brain Segmentation model:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-segmentation.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd brain-segmentation

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main script:
python brain_segmentation.py

Follow the instructions to input a brain scan image and see the segmented output.

Results
The performance of the Brain Segmentation model is evaluated using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), accuracy, and loss. The results are included in the project report, with visualizations that highlight the model's effectiveness in segmenting different brain regions.

Contributing
Contributions to the Brain Segmentation project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the model, adding features, or fixing bugs, feel free to submit a pull request.
