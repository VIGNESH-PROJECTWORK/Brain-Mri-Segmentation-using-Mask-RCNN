Project Title: Brain Segmentation using Mask R-CNN
Description:
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for brain segmentation using the Mask R-CNN architecture powered by Detectron2. The model is designed to accurately identify and segment brain regions in medical images, contributing to tasks such as disease diagnosis, tumor detection, and anatomical research.

Key Features:
Mask R-CNN Architecture: Utilizes Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation, which enables precise pixel-level segmentation of brain regions.
Detectron2 Framework: Built on Detectron2, a modular and efficient object detection library from Facebook AI Research (FAIR), providing faster training and inference.
Dataset: The model is trained on [mention dataset, if public], or if it's custom, you can explain its size and structure.
Performance: Achieves high accuracy in detecting and segmenting brain regions with minimal false positives and negatives.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Detectron2
PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy
